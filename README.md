<h1>Responsive Mobile-first Web Design Navigation</h1>

<p>In this repository there are several examples of responsive, mobile-first website navigation menues. These are from the PluralSight Course: <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/responsive-web-design-navigation">Hands-on Responsive Web Design 4: Navigation</a>. For each page, you can play around with expanding and shrinking the screen size to watch the responsiveness between small, medium, and large screen sizes.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The best way to view these examples is to either clone the repository or download the files and open the files on your local machine.</p>

<p>1) This first <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Design_Navigation/blob/master/CoverNavigation/index.html">example</a> demonstrates Cover Navigation by simply dropping all of the menu links to cover the page. When viewed on medium screens, the hidden navigation is replaced with a navigation bar across the screen.</p>

<p>2) This second <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Design_Navigation/blob/master/ExpandingNavigation/index.html">example</a> displays Expanding Navigation with a hidden nav menu on mobile screens. When the hamburger menu button is clicked, the menu expands and the rest of the page's content slides down. The content returns to where it was when the menu button is clicked again. When displayed on medium and large screen sizes, the hidden nav menu turns into a permanent nav bar across the screen.</p>

<p>3) Touch Navigation is used in this third <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Design_Navigation/blob/master/ExpandOnTouch/index.html">example</a> and shows how submenus can be hidden and revealed on touch when viewed on small and medium screens. When viewed on larger screens, the navigation changes into a nav bar across the screen with scroll over drop-down menues.</p>

<p>4) In this fourth <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Design_Navigation/blob/master/SingleNavigation/index.html#top">example</a>, Single-Level Navigation is employed and is my least favorite of all the navigation designs. When viewed on smaller screens, the nav is hidden as it is on all the other designs, and when the menu button is clicked, the menu appears, taking up the entire screen. The problem with this navigation is that all the links are visible at the bottom of the page when the menu is "closed." This does not give a true sense that the navigation is hidden as it does with the other design examples. The power of this design shows through on the medium and large screens, because they are built with CSS Grids, using grid-template-areas to change the view with a few simple lines of code. When viewed on medium screens, the navigation shifts to the left side and is always visible. When viewed on large screens, the navigation becomes a nav bar across the screen below the logo.</p>

<p>In this fifth and final <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Design_Navigation/blob/master/IconNavigation/index.html">example</a>, Icons are used for navigation. When viewed on small screens, only the icons appear and are fixed to the bottom of the screen at all times. The subnavigation items popup above the icons when the icon is clicked. When viewed on medium screens, text appears below each icon to better help the user understand the navigation. Everything else works the same as when view on small screens. When viewed on large screens, the navigation turns into a nav bar across the top of the screen and the icons disappear so that only the text is displayed for each menu item. As with all the rest of the examples that use the CSS background-image property with relative URLs, the images will not display properly in the GitHub previewer unless you inspect the page and delete one of the periods. Example: change background-image: url(../images/icon_deals.png); <strong>to</strong> background-image: url(./images/icon_deals.png);</p>
