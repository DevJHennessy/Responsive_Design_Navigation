<h1>Mobile-first Expanding Navigation</h1>

<p>A mobile-first website example that displays an expandable navigtaion menu when viewed on small screens (< 560px). When the hamburger menu button is clicked, the menu expands and the rest of the page's content slides down. The content returns to where it was when the menu button is clicked again. When displayed on medium and large screen sizes, the hidden nav menu turns into a permanent nav bar across the screen. On medium screens (560px - 1027px), the first word of each link is hidden to ensure that the content fits the page. When viewed on large screens (> 1028px), the first word of each link is displayed.</p>

<p>You can check out this <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Design_Navigation/blob/master/ExpandingNavigation/index.html">example</a> and play around with the responsiveness of the grids from small, medium, and large screens.</p>
